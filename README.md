North East Tech Solution: Bridging the Theory-to-Practice Gap

🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the marketing landing page for North East Tech Solution, a venture focused on solving the critical skill gap faced by college students in the technology sector. We provide the tools necessary to convert theoretical knowledge into a portfolio of job-ready, real-world applications.

✨ Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

Our platform is the only educational solution featuring an AI-powered Theory-to-Practice Linkage Engine that instantly connects academic concepts (like algorithms) directly to functional code and guided, industry-vetted projects.

🎯 Target Audience

Tech-aspirant youth (aged 18-28) in North East India enrolled in B.Tech/Engineering programs, who are struggling with low motivation and limited practical skill development due to the disconnection between classroom theory and real-world job requirements.

⚙️ Setup and Deployment

This project is a single-page static website, making it extremely easy to deploy.
